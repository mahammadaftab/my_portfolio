# Enhanced Skills Page Animations

## Overview

The enhanced skills page features advanced animations and motion effects for the "Technologies I Work With" section. Each technology card has scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and interactive feedback.

## Features

1. **Entrance Animations**
   - Cards animate in with staggered delays
   - Spring physics for natural movement
   - Fade and scale effects

2. **Interactive Hover Effects**
   - Cards lift up on hover
   - Scale increase for emphasis
   - Enhanced shadow for depth
   - Smooth transitions

3. **Touch Feedback**
   - Scale reduction on tap/click
   - Visual feedback for interactions

4. **Accessibility Support**
   - Respects user's reduced motion preferences
   - Smooth animations that don't cause motion sickness
   - Proper ARIA attributes

5. **Visual Design**
   - Gradient initials for each technology
   - Consistent card design
   - Responsive layout
   - Dark mode support

## Implementation Details

### Animation Properties

#### Initial State
```tsx
initial={prefersReducedMotion ? { opacity: 1 } : { 
  opacity: 0, 
  y: 20,
  scale: 0.9 
}}
```

#### Animation Trigger
```tsx
animate={prefersReducedMotion ? { opacity: 1 } : { 
  opacity: 1, 
  y: 0,
  scale: 1 
}}
```

#### Hover Effects
```tsx
whileHover={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { 
  y: -10, 
  scale: 1.05,
  boxShadow: "0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 10px 10px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)",
  transition: { duration: 0.2 }
}}
```

#### Staggered Delays
```tsx
transition={{ 
  duration: 0.5, 
  delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : index * 0.1,
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 100
}}
```

## Customization Options

### Adjust Animation Timing
```tsx
transition={{ 
  duration: 0.5, 
  delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : index * 0.1,
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 100
}}
```

### Modify Hover Effects
```tsx
whileHover={prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { 
  y: -10, 
  scale: 1.05,
  boxShadow: "0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 10px 10px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)",
  transition: { duration: 0.2 }
}}
```

### Change Visual Design
```tsx
className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center w-32 h-32 cursor-pointer"
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Animation Efficiency**
   - Spring physics for natural movement
   - Optimized transition properties
   - Minimal DOM updates

2. **Accessibility**
   - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
   - Smooth animations without abrupt movements
   - Proper cursor indicators

## Browser Support

The implementation works in all modern browsers that support:
- CSS transforms
- CSS transitions
- React hooks

Fallbacks are provided for users with reduced motion preferences.

## React Hook Compliance

The implementation follows React's Rules of Hooks by:
- Calling hooks at the top level of the component
- Not calling hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
- Maintaining consistent hook order across renders
